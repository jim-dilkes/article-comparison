currently us based former foreign secretary also refused to rule out a future run for the labour leadership although admitted a return to politics was hard to see at present the press association reported miliband told the times im obviously deeply concerned that labour is further from power than at any stage in my lifetime asked about his future he added i honestly dont know what im going to do its hard to see but whats the point of saying never have warned the party was on course for a catastrophic general election defeat after the conservatives snatched the seat of copeland which had been held by labour since number corbyn said the result was very disappointing but made clear he would resist calls to resign i was elected to lead this party i am proud to lead this party he told reporters we will continue our campaigning work on the nhs on social care on housing one leading trade union figure warned corbyn he had to turn things around and show he could deliver a labour government while another said he needs to take responsibility for improving the fortunes sooner rather than later following a tumultuous election night on thursday a jubilant may travelled north to copeland to hail an astounding victory for tory candidate harrison her triumph was the first gain for a governing party in a parliamentary by election since number later may told the conservative councillors association conference in labours devastating defeat showed it is out of touch with the concerns of ordinary working people and that only the tories can truly call itself the party of working people there was some consolation for labour in stoke on central where it saw off a concerted challenge from ukip leader paul albeit with a reduced majority but there was despair among at the defeat in copeland with john woodcock mp for neighbouring barrow in warning the party was heading for a historic and catastrophic defeat at the general election senior labour backbencher david said corbyn was an obstacle to victory and should consider his position as he is simply not acceptable to traditional labour voters labours shadow leader of the lords baroness smith described the copeland defeat as devastating and said corbyn should think long and hard about his response baroness smith the shadow leader of the house of lords and a former labour mp said that corbyn had to take more care to reflect official party policy on nuclear power and weapons in a bid to reconnect with voters she told the post uk i think jeremy will be very disappointed at the election result i cant believe for one moment he draws any comfort from that result and he will be clearly be thinking long and hard about it lady smith suggested long standing personal objections to nuclear power may have harmed labour in the seat which is home to the reprocessing plant the labour party has always been a broad coalition and on nuclear theres always been differently held views she said yet the leader has to reflect the views of the party as a whole dave general secretary of the unison trade union said while the blame for a disastrous defeat did not lie solely with corbyn he had to take responsibility for what happened next nurses teaching assistants care workers and ordinary people everywhere need a labour government jeremy has to show he understands how to turn things around and deliver just that he said the leader of the shop workers trade union john said the by election results raise questions about labours electability and the vision it offers to the people of this country said the electorate clearly have doubts about labours message and direction of travel all sections of the party from the leader to elected office holders and the members need to listen to those doubts and learn from them labour needs a clear credible message that people can believe in and jeremy corbyn needs to take responsibility for delivering that sooner rather than later despite the despondency on the labour benches there was little mood for a fresh leadership challenge with fearing it would lead to a repeat of last years crushing victory for corbyn labour campaigns chairman a leadership loyalist insisted
