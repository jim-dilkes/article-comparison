making a rare intervention in british politics calls the vote a historic mistake warns may of cheap rhetoric and criticises brexit ers for shouting down those who want to remain in the european union sir john says should not keep quiet and toe the line his comments echo those made by fellow ex pm tony blair who two weeks ago waded back into british politics by urging the public to rise up and change their mind on brexit if may tries to quit the eu at any cost both sir john and blair campaigned for remain ahead of the referendum and shared a platform to make the case not to quit the eu in his house address sir john pulls few punches over his fears for the consequences for the uk once article number is triggered and the uk prepares to quit the bloc he says he has been contacted by remain voters of persuasions who are in dismay even despair they do not deserve to be told that they must keep quiet and toe the line he says appearing to encourage protest a popular triumph at the polls even in a referendum does not take away the right to disagree nor the right to express that dissent the particular fear i have is that those most likely to be hurt will be those least able to protect themselves sir john major he says freedom of speech is the will of the people a frequent charge levelled at they people he down their legitimate comment is against all our traditions of tolerance it does nothing to inform and everything to demean and it is time it stopped heres the full passage defending the number this number care no less for our country than the number who voted to leave they are every bit as patriotic but they take a different view of future role in the world and are deeply worried for themselves for their families and for our country they do not deserve to be told that since the decision has been taken they must keep quiet and toe the line a popular triumph at the polls even in a referendum does not take away the right to disagree nor the right to express that dissent freedom of speech is absolute in our country its not arrogant or brazen or elitist or remotely delusional to express concern about our future after brexit nor by doing so is this group undermining the will of the people they are the people shouting down their legitimate comment is against all our traditions of tolerance it does nothing to inform and everything to demean and it is time it stopped sir john goes on to back parliament having the final say on the brexit vote our parliament is not a rubber stamp and should not be treated as if it were he also fears breaking ties with the eu will far more dependent upon the united states and appears to have little confidence in president trump being the salvation arguing the uk is reliant on a president less predictable less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors behind the diplomatic civilities the atmosphere is already sour a little more charm and a lot less cheap rhetoric would do much to protect the interests sir john major he goes on to suggest brexit will diminish the special relationship once we are out of the eu our relationship with the united states will change she needs a close ally inside the eu once outside that can no longer be us against a backdrop of right wing parties in strong positions ahead of elections across europe this year sir john thinks brexit has energised the anti eu anti immigrant nationalists that are growing in number in france germany holland and other european countries he says none of these populist groups is sympathetic to the broadly tolerant and liberal instincts of the british nonetheless their pitch is straightforward if britain sober stable moderate reliable britain with its ancient parliament and anti revolutionary history can break free of a repressive bureaucracy in brussels why then so can anyone it is a potent appeal he adds i caution everyone to be wary of this kind of populism it seems to be a mixture of bigotry prejudice and intolerance it scapegoats minorities it is a poison in any political system destroying civility and decency and understanding here in the uk we should give it short shrift for it is not the people we are nor the country we are sir john fears trade negotiations are already sour and calls for a little more charm and a lot less cheap rhetoric and he is concerned who voted to leave europe to improve their lives will be disappointed if events go badly their expectations will not be met and whole communities will be worse off the particular fear i have

do its hard to see but whats the point of saying never have warned the party was on course for a catastrophic general election defeat after the conservatives snatched the seat of copeland which had been held by labour since number corbyn said the result was very disappointing but made clear he would resist calls to resign i was elected to lead this party i am proud to lead this party he told
