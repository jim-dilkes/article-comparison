127	1488299230	can a protein heavy diet become an unhealthy obsession	when eaten as part of a balanced diet protein allows our body to grow and repair is there a risk of becoming obsessed with protein to the extent that behaviour becomes symptomatic of disorder the term has been coined to describe an unhealthy fixation with protein heavy foods and supplements such as protein shakes and chicken according to the numerous outlets and writing on the subject those suffering also tend to cut out foods they deem unhealthy such as in a bid to lose weight or build muscle the term has been linked to a condition defined as an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating which has yet to be formally recognised as an eating disorder according to eating disorders charity beat much like is not a recognised eating disorder and we should be careful how we are using the term however that doesnt mean people are not displaying concerning or unhealthy behaviours when it comes to consuming protein speaking to the post uk a spokesperson from beat said placing severe restrictions on diet is obviously not healthy and may be an indication of an eating disorder but its important to remember that eating disorders are not really about food itself but about thoughts and feelings they added a sufferers treatment of food whether restricting purging or any combination of these may be about coping with these thoughts and feelings or a way to feel in control its entirely possible that someone might use clean eating or protein shakes in this way but is not a clinical diagnosis despite this there are studies to suggest many are experiencing an unhealthy or obsessive relationship with protein a number study by dr richard and dr peter theodore found that many men who use protein powder to build muscle feel similar psychological pressure to people been diagnosed with recognised eating disorders in the study of almost number men who use the powders number said they were worried by their supplement intake while a further number admitted theyd been advised to reduce their use by a medical professional the study suggested body conscious individuals often began consuming high levels of protein believing those with ripped torsos must be healthy without realising the internal impact this may cause but how can you recognise if your gym buddy is using protein shakes to simply improve their workout or if theyre part of a more serious underlying issue according to beat its common to believe you can see an eating disorder but they are mental illnesses and psychological and behavioural signs are likely to emerge long before physical ones secretiveness around or preoccupation with food becoming withdrawn mood swings low self esteem tiredness and distorted perceptions of weight are some of the signs that someone might be developing some form of eating disorder the spokesperson said beat has recently launched a campaign to help people recognise the early signs of eating disorders writing for health sarah identified as a and said she initially upped her protein intake to enhance her workouts but things soon got out of hand at first i found that a shake post workout upped my stamina and annulled my hunger she said so i started subbing one in for breakfast and as i became more interested in how protein could fuel my workout and the inevitable how could be hindering my results every meal became based around it an inevitable part of the process was that became all but banished from my diet soon began to struggle to focus at work and constantly felt too tired to socialise with friends thankfully she visited a nutritionist who explained her restrictive diet was to blame and helped her reintroduce balance to her life nutritionist and british dietetic association miles told uk on consuming a lot of one nutrient such as protein you are likely to be restricting other food groups such as carbohydrates this may lead to you missing out on other important parts of a diet such as fibre she said fibre is found in fruit vegetables and and is really important for a healthy digestive system she explained that protein may fill someone up so much that they are unable to eat enough of the other things we need in our diet animal protein often contains saturated fat so if people are increasing their protein intake using animal protein it may be detrimental to heart health by increasing their intake of saturated fat she said there are risks of having an unbalanced diet including vitamin and mineral deficiencies and in the long term increasing the risk of developing chronic conditions type type see also number according to concerned that they or someone they know may be developing an eating disorder should access treatment as quickly as possible as this ensures the best chance of recovery the first port of call is usually your gp who should ideally refer you for assessment by an eating disorders specialist they said beat has produced literature to help sufferers those supporting them and gps during the appointment to help get a positive outcome here and of course the beat is also available every day from number number on number number number or at help b for anyone who is worried about themselves or someone they know while its important to be mindful of our protein intake and take any potential signs of any eating disorder seriously nutrition consultant charlotte stirling reed confirmed that we should not fear protein protein is one of the building blocks of life and therefore is an important macronutrient to include in your diet every day she told uk most of us get enough protein by eating a well balanced diet and varying the foods we eat every day so there is no need to worry too much about getting enough including

133	1488297863	number did captain of missing malaysia airlines flight murder everyone on board	as the mystery of what happened on board malaysia airlines flight number continues the finger of blame has been pointed once more at the actions of a rogue pilot the bound flight with number souls on board captained by shah went missing an hour into its departure from on number march number more than number items of debris suspected or confirmed to be from the plane have washed ashore on coastlines throughout the indian ocean since then but a deep sea sonar search for the main underwater wreckage has yielded nothing crash expert larry met with investigative journalist mark williams thomas to discuss the fate of the missing airliner on this morning is certain only one theory can account for what happened to the boeing number that it was brought down intentionally by a pilot he said this is a mass murder theres no other explanation for it i believe that one of the pilots in the cockpit took the aircraft and landed it deliberately in the ocean so that it would remain basically in one piece and sink to the bottom and never be seen again the first piece of wreckage found was a manually operated part from the plane wing with williams thomas remarking whats crucial about this piece of wreckage is that it was found in the extended position which could only have been done by the pilot to land the plane retired airline pilot marshall was then asked if it would be possible for a plane of that size and with that many passengers on board to hit the water without breaking up the impact would be survivable he admitted speaking in july told number minutes program somebody was flying the airplane into the water comments are believed to have highlighted to search crews that if the plane was piloted until it hit the water and thus contrary to the hypothesis it was not under human control when it crashed it could have landed outside of the search area added everybody should then have concluded in my opinion that this was a human engineered event theres no other explanation while the theory that shah committed suicide and killed everyone else on board is a common one it is at odds with that which suggests the crash was an act of heroism rather than hijacking in an online thesis australian aviation enthusiast michael gilbert speculates shah if it was indeed him at the controls at the time deliberately steered the plane which had suffered an on board fire off course to avoid a densely populated city thus saving lives type type related number based on the research of maintenance records and previous accidents gilbert surmises a windshield heater fire could have triggered the planes turn off course in an attempt to divert to an airport in penang with evidence of an oxygen leak in the cockpit causing the blaze to intensify quickly faulty windshield heaters have previously caused fires forcing aircraft to divert to nearby airports whats more gilbert explains a windshield heater fire can explain both the loss of the transponder signal and the interruption to the satellite communications link the subsequent failure of the windshield would have extinguished the fire but also caused a rapid gilbert adds within number number minutes of the event number number minutes before reaching penang almost everybody on board would have been dead but gilbert believes one of the pilots survived the fire and event because they were wearing breathing apparatus or possibly because they were outside the cockpit retrieving an extra fire extinguisher when the windshield failed gilbert writes on approaching penang the surviving pilot would have come to the realisation that he had no means of communication radio communication panel keypads microphones and headsets would have been burned or melted by the fire the pilot would have also realised that there was no reasonable chance of manually flying the airplane he had no instruments it was night there was no moon he could only occupy the cockpit for short periods of time and oxygen supplies were dwindling any attempt to take manual control of the airplane would almost invariably end with loss of control and there would be no guarantee that he could re engage the autopilot if he disengaged it gilbert points out that just off the starboard wing was penang with its population of number people and that immediately ahead lay the strait of malacca the worlds second busiest shipping lane given the situation i believe that the pilot then elected to do what many pilots in stricken airplanes have done in the past steer it clear of populated areas according to gilberts theory the surviving pilot will have been exposed to number temperatures for over an hour and would have been suffering from hypothermia when he decided to simply point the airplane in the safest possible direction before succumbing to hypoxia himself gilbert believes number eventually ran out of fuel and came down around number north of the search area highlighted by the australian transport safety bureau in january the deep sea search for the missing airliner officially ended leaving its final resting place one of
