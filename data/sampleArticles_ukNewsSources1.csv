120	1488218980	sir john major slams mays cheap rhetoric in bruising brexit warning	sir john major has delivered a withering assessment of brexit warning the uk will become reliant on an unpredictable donald trump risks making the poorest worse off and could unleash europe wide populism marked by bigotry prejudice and intolerance in a speech the former conservative prime minister making a rare intervention in british politics calls the vote a historic mistake warns may of cheap rhetoric and criticises brexit ers for shouting down those who want to remain in the european union sir john says should not keep quiet and toe the line his comments echo those made by fellow ex pm tony blair who two weeks ago waded back into british politics by urging the public to rise up and change their mind on brexit if may tries to quit the eu at any cost both sir john and blair campaigned for remain ahead of the referendum and shared a platform to make the case not to quit the eu in his house address sir john pulls few punches over his fears for the consequences for the uk once article number is triggered and the uk prepares to quit the bloc he says he has been contacted by remain voters of persuasions who are in dismay even despair they do not deserve to be told that they must keep quiet and toe the line he says appearing to encourage protest a popular triumph at the polls even in a referendum does not take away the right to disagree nor the right to express that dissent the particular fear i have is that those most likely to be hurt will be those least able to protect themselves sir john major he says freedom of speech is the will of the people a frequent charge levelled at they people he down their legitimate comment is against all our traditions of tolerance it does nothing to inform and everything to demean and it is time it stopped heres the full passage defending the number this number care no less for our country than the number who voted to leave they are every bit as patriotic but they take a different view of future role in the world and are deeply worried for themselves for their families and for our country they do not deserve to be told that since the decision has been taken they must keep quiet and toe the line a popular triumph at the polls even in a referendum does not take away the right to disagree nor the right to express that dissent freedom of speech is absolute in our country its not arrogant or brazen or elitist or remotely delusional to express concern about our future after brexit nor by doing so is this group undermining the will of the people they are the people shouting down their legitimate comment is against all our traditions of tolerance it does nothing to inform and everything to demean and it is time it stopped sir john goes on to back parliament having the final say on the brexit vote our parliament is not a rubber stamp and should not be treated as if it were he also fears breaking ties with the eu will far more dependent upon the united states and appears to have little confidence in president trump being the salvation arguing the uk is reliant on a president less predictable less reliable and less attuned to our free market and socially liberal instincts than any of his predecessors behind the diplomatic civilities the atmosphere is already sour a little more charm and a lot less cheap rhetoric would do much to protect the interests sir john major he goes on to suggest brexit will diminish the special relationship once we are out of the eu our relationship with the united states will change she needs a close ally inside the eu once outside that can no longer be us against a backdrop of right wing parties in strong positions ahead of elections across europe this year sir john thinks brexit has energised the anti eu anti immigrant nationalists that are growing in number in france germany holland and other european countries he says none of these populist groups is sympathetic to the broadly tolerant and liberal instincts of the british nonetheless their pitch is straightforward if britain sober stable moderate reliable britain with its ancient parliament and anti revolutionary history can break free of a repressive bureaucracy in brussels why then so can anyone it is a potent appeal he adds i caution everyone to be wary of this kind of populism it seems to be a mixture of bigotry prejudice and intolerance it scapegoats minorities it is a poison in any political system destroying civility and decency and understanding here in the uk we should give it short shrift for it is not the people we are nor the country we are sir john fears trade negotiations are already sour and calls for a little more charm and a lot less cheap rhetoric and he is concerned who voted to leave europe to improve their lives will be disappointed if events go badly their expectations will not be met and whole communities will be worse off the particular fear i have is that those most

124	1488213169	wet ukip to blame for stoke defeat say	thanks to you stoke was our best fought by election ever not the words you would expect to read from the ukip chairman after thursdays defeat but that was the subject line of an email sent out by paul to party members on saturday afternoon many of us had hoped that wed be starting our day today with a second ukip mp read the email before continuing the work that so many of you put into helping our campaign in stoke deserved far more than the second place we achieved truly ive never seen a ukip campaign like it this is hilarious remarked one who had been with the party for more than ten years after reading the message but just why did ukip fall short in a by election that seemed easier to win than lose the party was competing in the so called brexit capital of the country against a deeply unpopular labour party in a seat that had a low turnout all the conditions needed for an upset despite coming second in stoke central in number the party did not put any resources into the seat in that campaign so when labour mp tristram hunt announced he was quitting as an mp in january this year ukip had no serious infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunity east of england tim aker was drafted in to help run the nuts and bolts of the campaigning operation when he arrived in stoke he discovered there was no data for him to work from and no archive of local issues for the party to focus on as a result he decided to play on the fact that stoke central was overwhelmingly with number of voters backing leave in last years referendum he told huff post uk if you are looking at a constituency where we dont have a single piece of data not one pledge you go for the low hanging fruit given that article number was going through parliament at the time and labour were at sixes and sevens over it this resulted in huge billboards going up proclaiming trust ukip to get us out of the eu labour wants to keep you in however tactics were not met with approval by all in the party one senior said he was working on the premise that there were a lot of people in stoke who didnt know that ukip were for brexit at the start of the campaign those people who didnt know that were probably non voters if you dont know that ukip wants to leave the eu are you the kind of person thats going to go out during a storm in february to vote it wasnt just billboards which were deemed to miss the target the campaign also left something to be desired one senior ukip official told huff post uk the first one had the same picture of paul on both sides obvious opportunity wasted there to do a bit more with it people like to spend a long time honing the fine details of the text on these things but i think the graphical impact on things are at least as important as the words you put on it brexit was not all the party decided to focus on the nhs played a central role in the by election ukip leader and stoke candidate paul had in the past talked up increasing in the health service something labour were keen to bring up as often as possible despite admitting he had changed his mind on the policy previous statements did have a cut through with voters brexit spokesman batten said the suggestion ukip want to the nhs has never been the case never was the case but its a lie that was peddled and it gained some traction in the constituency because as we knocked on doors people were bringing it up the party tried to counter this by sending out leaflets claiming dont believe labours lies paul and ukip will never the nhs however this constant focus on the health service meant ukip was spending much less time than normal taking about a subject it had dominated for years immigration speaking after the defeat former leader nigel farage was clear the party had not exploited the issue enough speaking to the he said there is a debate in ukip as to how strong we should be on the immigration issue i personally think we should own it so we will have to look at that and think were we really tough enough were we clear enough with the electorate it has got to be looked at one member high up in the farage wing of ukip said the problem was wet ukip having too much influence over paul and the campaign and singled out former daily express political editor patrick as wetter in chief left fleet street for politics in number and was elected as an that year despite describing farage as his political hero the ex journalist has clashed with the former party leader on numerous occasions after the number general election quit his role as economic spokesman after claiming advisors had made him appear thin skinned snarling and aggressive in last years referendum was the only ukip not to be seduced by farage into backing banks organisation and then grassroots out for designation as the official leave campaign instead supported vote leave also backed by ukip mp douglas after was elected ukip leader in november was appointed as one of his closest advisors with his knowledge of the media deemed crucial in helping get message across to voters above the door of campaign headquarters were branded three pledges on the nhs immigration and a speedy brexit the fact the nhs was top above immigration was deemed a sign that wet ukip was in charge a senior ukip official contrasted running the campaign on the nhs with trying to win over the conservative voters needed to take the seat theres no evidence of that at all either in the leaflet design or in the canvassing if we were doing that i think it was only in patrick own mind they said of course there was another factor which played a role in defeat the unraveling of the claim on his that he lost close friends at the disaster was exposed as untrue and even though a long serving press officer held her hands up and admitted the mistake the perception of shiftiness remained it wasnt the first time personal history needed correcting claims he had been a footballer for rovers when he had only been a youth player and had a when he had in fact only started a doctorate were also given an airing indeed he was even exposed for not having stayed in the stoke house he had registered as his address it all painted a picture of someone who could not quite be trusted douglas still only mp refused to blame those revelations for defeat but did think the legacy if the farage inspired shock and awe tactics used in the number general election had left a legacy around the party if a large number of people are willing believe the worst about you you need to ask why that is he told huff post uk despite the defeat ukip is taking some positives from the by election it managed to mobilise hundreds of activists in a short space of time and from a standing start now has contact information on thousands of voters but there is no doubt that despite the positives this is a huge set back for the party in its attempt to eat into the labour heartlands in the midlands and the north it is now at a crossroads and is finally having the conversation which many in the party believed it should have had after the number general election does it carry on with the farage tactics of focusing on immigration which leaves it open to the charge of the nasty party does it try to rebrand or in many ways return to its roots as a small state libertarian insurgency there is even a third possibility with ukip becoming a party which attacks and talks up state intervention as the way to resuscitate left behind communities whichever path it chooses until it ups its ground game the party will continue to struggle to win by elections this feed and its contents are the property of the post uk and use is subject to our terms it may be used

generation of voters do not believe there is a single politician trustworthy enough to run the country a landmark study of number to number year olds has revealed according to the trust barometer a long running integrity and credibility survey the majority of these teens feel helpless about their prospects distrusting of the government and the british people to protect their future the group labelled generation angst narrowly missed out on voting in the eu referendum they believe they have been left a poisoned legacy with more than a third number claiming their standard of living will be worse than older generations the main findings of the survey show only number now feel confident about their future post brexit none of the above ranked higher than all uk political leaders london mayor sadiq khan most trusted to do what is right number in number are worried about the pace of change of social media young people are more likely to consider experts believable uk chief executive ed williams said the results paint a troubling picture of todays is a swathe of anxious young people who are looking for reassurance about the future he said they have left childhood behind but dont like that they see up ahead of them rather than the optimism of youth they show a greater angst about the future than their parents a single politician qualified to run britain generation angst do not trust a single external institution to deliver the future they aspire to with number to number year olds unable to put confidence in the uk government the british people the monarchy or the european union to protect their prospects the study of number teens claims for this group only their friends family and own generation are considered trustworthy generation angst is equally dismissive about individual politicians and their parties while this group put significantly more trust in the labour party and the green party number and number compared to the tories number as with british adults young people are distrusting of all political parties perhaps the most troubling result however was the fact that the next generation of uk voters does not believe there is a single politician qualified to run the country when the teens were asked who they would vote for in a general election the overwhelming response was none of them at number labour leader jeremy corbyn was the highest ranking politician with number of the theoretical votes while current prime minister may received just number number less than her predecessor david london mayor sadiq khan was revealed to be the politician teens trust most to do what is right with a rating of just number brexit is a major worry for remain backing teens brexit represents one of the biggest sources of worry for generation study revealed with number of number to number year olds claiming they would have voted remain in the eu referendum only number now feel confident about their future post brexit many of the group narrowly missed out on the chance to number house of lords voted to lower the voting age to number the eu referendum on the grounds that it would help get more teenagers involved in politics however in the commons blocked the move with some pro leave politicians arguing that it would give the remain camp an unfair advantage more than half number of teens now say that brexit should not be acted on with number demanding a second referendum in much higher numbers than the general population generation angst fears the decision to leave the eu will have a negative impact on the economy society and the prospects of future generations almost two thirds of teens number also believe that political stability in europe will be damaged by brexit number more than the british public overall generation angst still values experts despite experts being slammed during the referendum campaign young people still value the the views of specialists much more so than the general public the survey found that number of number to number year olds consider experts more believable than people like me this was the case for only number of the british public as a whole although they are considered to be the social media generation teenagers still consider traditional media sources to be more trust worthy than online sources three quarters said they would believe the word of newspapers and tv over social media while this was the case for only number of the general population first victims of the social media explosion one of the more surprising revelations from the survey is the fact that the majority of young people are worried about how quickly social media is changing far more anxious than their parents and grandparents despite three quarters of number to number year olds using social media every single day with and listed as their number are worried about the pace of change of these sites and in a survey of the general public only number listed this as a cause for concern claims that the results show young people are likely to become the first victims of the social media explosion as they fail to keep up with the pace of change managing director of intelligence told the post uk we

commercial and category if a video package c sponsorship number commercial video package a c i player else t function t number number unborn identical twin boys have been captured moving inside womb at number weeks in a fascinating video and photo series detailed facial features and nails growing on the can clearly be seen in the photos taken by surgeons who had to operate on the children before they were born the footage was taken during laser ablation surgery to treat twin to twin transfusion syndrome a condition that affects identical twins who share a placenta it can be fatal or leave them with disabilities laser ablation is often the best way to treat it but can be a risky procedure parents sarah and dan maund from have shared the photos to raise awareness of the syndrome i was just blown away when i saw the pictures for the first time said sarah maund number maund added i knew it was bittersweet we saw these amazing photographs that most parents will never have the opportunity to see but at the same time we were still under admission at the hospital and they were still really concerned about the twins the photographs were taken by surgeon and multiple births expert professor at st in number he said i dont think all laser ablation surgeons do this but i think its nice to save the photographs and video for the families so that they can see their babies sadly for some families this will be the only chance they get to see them alive as not all twins will survive to full term maund was under a local anaesthetic when the procedure took place she was laying flat when the photos were taken so she only saw the images a few weeks later however her husband was in theatre with her at the time and saw the images on the screen i watched the whole thing on the monitor it was amazing he said the images were so clear they were like a normal photograph i saw putting the camera into womb too occurs in about number number of identical twin pregnancies if left untreated number of these babies will die according to twins charity even with treatment there is only up to a number chance of both babies surviving the condition affects the amount of blood passing to the twins if the blood doesnt flow evenly between the placenta and the twins one baby in this case will get too much blood which puts a strain on their heart they are known as the recipient baby the other twin in this case henry is known as the donor baby as they receive less blood from the placenta and can become smaller and anaemic laser ablation surgery can correct this imbalance by sealing off some of the blood vessels in the placenta so that both babies receive a more equal supply of blood dan said it was very very scary i cant even imagine what it was like for sarah but for me when we were in the hospital for the operation thats when the emotions started flowing i knew i needed to be as strong as i could for sarah thats all i could really do the couple had a six hour wait for a scan to see if the procedure had worked and to find out if both twins still had heartbeats from then on sarah kept up her regular scan appointments every few days and by number weeks the had resolved itself but a few weeks later she was diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction which caused her to go into early labour the boys arrived on number september number by emergency caesarean section at number weeks five weeks early for a twin were sent to the special care unit but after four weeks in hospital they were allowed home they now enjoy playing cars with older brother three year old and getting into mischief sarah said when i look at the womb photographs and i look at the boys now i cant believe how far weve all was an incredible gift for professor to give us we were given a one in three chance of both of them surviving so we know how lucky we are to have two happy healthy survivors but i know from hearing stories from other parents that it isnt always a happy ending to the story which is why research into is so vital wed encourage people to give what they can to registry so doctors can learn more about the condition and improve the chances of more babies surviving in future national charity twins and multiple births association set up the registry in december number since then nine hospitals have signed up to the registry and are now inputting data about their patients into the system this data will be used to learn more about and increase the chances of twins surviving the condition in future reed said without someone doing research and tests in the first place we wouldnt have the laser ablation surgery today now we need more research so the chances of survival can increase and we see more twins surviving in future but sadly all this comes at a price and we desperately need money to continue funding this project id urge anyone to give what they can and donate to our appeal to save more tiny lives in future for more information visit type type see
